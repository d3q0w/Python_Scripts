# üêç Black Hat Python ‚Äì Script Collection

Welcome to my personal repository of scripts inspired by the book **Black Hat Python**. This repo contains my scripts, explorations, and implementations as I work through the book to deepen my understanding of python for offensive security.

## üìÇ About This Repository

Unlike a chapter-wise breakdown, this repository is a **loose collection of scripts** created as I progressed through the book. These scripts reflect practical experiments, code rewrites, extensions, and customizations based on the book's content.

You‚Äôll find:

- Custom-built backdoors and trojans
- Network sniffers and packet manipulators
- Keyloggers and data exfiltration tools
- C2 (command and control) skeletons
- Pythonic exploitation tools
- Obfuscation and evasion concepts
- and more...

some of the scripts may include inline comments for clarity or modifications from the original examples.

## üß∞ Requirements

Most scripts use Python 3 and may require additional modules such as:

- `socket`
- `threading`
- `scapy`
- `pycrypto` / `cryptography`
- `pynput`
- `requests`
- `subprocess`

Feel free to import them or install them when needed.
